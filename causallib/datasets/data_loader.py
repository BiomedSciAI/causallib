    Data was gathered during an observational study conducted by the NHANS

    decided to quite smoking and some decided to persist, and record the
    gain in weight for each individual to try estimate the causal contribution
    of smoking cessation on weight gain.

    This dataset is used throughout Hernán and Robins' Causal Inference Book.

    Args:
        raw (bool): Whether to return the entire DataFrame and descriptors or not.
                    If False, only confounders are used for the data.

    The dataset is based on real covariates but synthetically simulates the treatment assignment
    and potential outcomes. It therefore also contains sufficient ground truth to evaluate
    the effect estimation of causal models.
    The competition introduced 7700 simulated files (100 instances for each of the 77
    data-generating-processes). We provide a smaller sample of one instance from 10
    DGPs. For the full dataset, see the link below to the competition site.

     for causal inference: Lessons learned from a data analysis competition."

    Args:
        instance (int): number between 1-10 (inclusive), dataset to load.
        raw (bool): Whether to apply contrast ("dummify") on non-numeric columns
                    If True, returns a (pd.DataFrame, pd.DataFrame) tuple (one for covariates and the second with
