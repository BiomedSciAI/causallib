        https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01621459.2016.1260466

        A method to balance observed covariates between treatment groups in observational studies.
        Down-weigh observations with extreme propensity and weigh up
        Put less importance to observations with extreme propensity scores,
        and put more emphasis on observations with a central tendency towards
        (i.e. overlapping propensity scores).

        Each unitâ€™s weight is proportional to the probability of that unit being
        assigned to the opposite group:
        w_i = 1 - Pr[A=a_i|Xi]

        This method assumes only two treatment groups exist.

        Args:
            learner: Initialized sklearn model.
            use_stabilized (bool): Whether to re-weigh the learned weights with the prevalence of the treatment.
